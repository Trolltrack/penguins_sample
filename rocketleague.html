     <h2 class="center6">Welcome to Rocket League</h2>
     
     
     <p>Rocket League is a Soccer/Car video game.
     </p>
     
     <p>When playing Rocket League I recomend playing with a controler. When you first start playing you will find it difficult to control your vehicle, just keep playing the tutoral untill you get it.  </p>
         
       <p>Once control is mastered you should start to see how the ball moves and the way it acts. the hardest part for me to get down was to learn the movement and gravity of the ball, I'd say the way to do that is to use "Free Play" and play around with the ball. Another way would be to just play a game, eather with AIs or starting a normal game, it's up to you(AIs are easier than other players, so the best chalenge would be to play a normal game).
     </p>
    <p>
        Training is Awesome! Use training to Master Rookie, Pro, and All-Star leagues. Arials are hard! Getting used to the controls will be extreamly helpful.
